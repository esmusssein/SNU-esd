# SNU_ESD
2015 Embedded System Design Course

Term project for 2015 Seoul National Univ. Embedded System Desginclass.
The project is to build a system that simulates Black-Scholes option pricing model 1,000 times faster than general purpose computer.
The system consists of an JNI Android application that interfaces with a human, a Linux kernel driver to interface FPGA embedded system and a digital system wrote in Verilog running on FPGA board that computes heavy main part of entire option pricing computation.
